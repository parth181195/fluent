# Fluent

![flutter_fluent.jpeg](./assets/flutter_fluent.jpeg)

Flutter implementation for microsoft fluent ui for now we are only targeting (ios and android we are planning for desktop elements but once desktop embedding is released in production same can be said for web as well)

android control reference : https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/android

ios control reference : https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/ios

this project is still in active development, and it's not ready for alpha  so for some cases it might not stable, and it can also receive braking changes frequently
